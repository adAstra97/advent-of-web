                Oh, just a little weather experiment. What, what is it hot?
                Yeah, sure, okay. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a
                time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get
                back to the year 1985. What, right here right now in the
                cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take
                that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with
                somebody else.

                No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how
                that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on
                your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you
                hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the
                idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.
                Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Now, of course not, Biff, now, I
                wouldn't want that to happen. Doc, wait. No, bastards. Nothing.

                Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the
                house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart
                just went out for him. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the
                world. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine
                that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year
                1985. Right. Maybe you were adopted.
