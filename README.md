2.	Apply it to methods in a user management class (e.g., login and logout).

Mock data:
```
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  login() {
    return `${this.name} has logged in.`;
  }
  logout() {
    return `${this.name} has logged out.`;
  }
}
```

2.	Use rotate and scale independently for smooth animations.
- DX Improvement: Reduces reliance on the complex transform shorthand, improving readability and maintainability.

### Day 11: JavaScript - Promise.withResolvers
- Task: Create a Debounced Search Box.
- Steps:
1.	Use Promise.withResolvers to debounce API calls during user input.
2.	Only trigger the API call if no input occurs for 300ms.
- DX Improvement: Simplifies promise-based workflows by avoiding manual resolve and reject handling.

### Day 12: CSS - New Color Functions
- Task: Build a Smooth Dark Mode Toggle.
- Steps:
1.	Use color-mix() to transition between light and dark themes.
2.	Apply the colors to the background and text dynamically.

### Day 13: JavaScript - Atomics.waitAsync
- Task: Synchronize Worker Progress.
- Steps:
1.	Use SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics.waitAsync to track progress across multiple workers.
2.	Log when all workers have completed their tasks.

Mock data:
```
const sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(4); // 4 bytes for one integer
const sharedArray = new Int32Array(sharedBuffer);
// Simulating worker progress
const workers = [
  { id: 1, name: "Worker 1", progress: 0 },
  { id: 2, name: "Worker 2", progress: 0 },
  { id: 3, name: "Worker 3", progress: 0 }
];
```
- DX Improvement: Enables efficient synchronization in multithreaded JavaScript applications.

### Day 14: CSS - Nesting
- Task: Refactor a Componentâ€™s Styles.
- Steps:
1.	Take a complex stylesheet for a card component and refactor it to use nesting.
2.	Group related styles hierarchically to reduce redundancy.
- DX Improvement: Improves stylesheet readability and organization, reducing maintenance overhead.

### Day 15: JavaScript - String.toWellFormed
- Task: Sanitize User Input for Unicode Compliance.
- Steps:
1.	Write a function that accepts any user input string.
2.	Use .toWellFormed() to ensure the string has no invalid surrogate pairs.
3.	Log or display the sanitized string to confirm itâ€™s valid.
- DX Improvement: Simplifies handling of malformed Unicode without manual checks or third-party libraries.

### Day 16: CSS - Subgrid
- Task: Align Nested Grids with Parent Grid.
- Steps:
1.	Create a parent grid layout with defined columns and rows.
2.	Add nested child elements that use subgrid to inherit column alignment.
3.	Style the nested grid to seamlessly align with the parent structure.
- DX Improvement: Simplifies nested layouts by eliminating the need to replicate grid definitions, reducing redundancy.

### Day 17: JavaScript - Object.groupBy
- Task: Group Transactions by Category.
- Steps:
1.	Take an array of transaction objects with properties like category and amount.
2.	Use Object.groupBy to organize transactions by category.
3.	Calculate and log total amounts per category.

Mock data:
```
const transactions = [
  { id: 1, amount: 500, category: "Food" },
  { id: 2, amount: 200, category: "Transport" },
  { id: 3, amount: 800, category: "Shopping" },
  { id: 4, amount: 150, category: "Food" },
  { id: 5, amount: 300, category: "Transport" }
];
```
- DX Improvement: Reduces boilerplate for grouping arrays, making it more intuitive and easier to read.

### Day 18: CSS - :is() Pseudo-Class
- Task: Simplify Shared Heading Styles.
- Steps:
1.	Apply common styles (e.g., color, font size) to h1, h2, and h3 using :is().
2.	Combine it with hover styles to apply consistent interactivity.
- DX Improvement: Avoids repetitive rules for selectors, reducing code size and improving maintainability.

### Day 19: JavaScript - WeakRefs Improvements
- Task: Implement a Lightweight Cache.
- Steps:
1.	Create a cache system that uses WeakRef for temporary storage of expensive computations.
2.	Test the cache by accessing or recreating values if they are garbage-collected.
- DX Improvement: Allows efficient memory management for temporary data, making applications more performant.

### Day 20: CSS - Media Query Range Syntax
- Task: Create Responsive Font Scaling.
- Steps:
1.	Use media queries with the new range syntax (width >= 400px) and (width <= 800px).
2.	Scale font sizes smoothly between 16px and 24px across this range.
- DX Improvement: Simplifies media query definitions, improving readability and reducing errors in responsive designs.

### Day 21: JavaScript - Symbol.hash
- Task: Use Hashable Objects as Map Keys.
- Steps:
1.	Define a custom object with Symbol.hash to create a unique hashable identifier.
2.	Store and retrieve the object from a Map using its hash.

Mock data:
```
class CustomObject {
  constructor(id, name) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }
  [Symbol.hash]() {
    return `${this.id}-${this.name}`;
  }
}
const obj1 = new CustomObject(1, "Alice");
const obj2 = new CustomObject(2, "Bob");
const obj3 = new CustomObject(3, "Charlie");
```
- DX Improvement: Solves the problem of using complex objects as map keys, improving data structure flexibility.

### Day 22: CSS - Accent-Color Property
